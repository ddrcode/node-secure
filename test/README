This folder contains set of test cases for node-secure module.
The tests had to be split into multiple files because they operate 
on global variables and permanently change their values and property
descriptors. 

Available tests:

TEST 1: node-secure-standard-test.js
Checks the module with standard situation, when none of the globals
has been overridden.

TEST 2: node-secure-overridden-test.js
Test with overridden global values.
Globals are not originally protected here
